				<!-- Introduction -->
				<section data-transition="slide-in fade-out" >
					<h3>Horizons are 360 degrees</h3>
					<aside class="notes">Today we're going to explore a few ideas about professionalism, pride in the craft and more generally: happiness as a human being, and why thats important</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-transition="slide-in fade-out" >
					<h3>Broaden your horizons</h3>
					<aside class="notes">Has anyone ever said this to you? Have you ever said this to anyone else? What do I do with this statement as a receiver? I'd like to talk about this idea, and what it means to me</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-transition="slide-in fade-out" >
					<img class="stretch" src="./assets/definition_horizon.png"></img>
					<aside class="notes">We're going to box it to a definition here</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-transition="slide-in fade-out" >
					<h3>The world is getting smaller</h3>
					<aside class="notes">Those more tangible horizons are getting smaller (in terms of circumference). Information is much easier to get hold of than ever before. More information available than you can consume in a lifetime, so we have to be selective.</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-transition="slide-in fade-out" >
					<h3>I used to be a developer</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
						I used to write code. I used to take specifications and tell computers to do the things other people were telling me to do.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-transition="slide-in fade-out" >
					<h3>I am now a software engineer</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
						At least I consider myself to be, and a number of things have happened that have changed my mind and made me reassess my perception of myself. In particular, I developed an interest in engineering, and what that means.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-transition="slide-in fade-out" >
					<img class="stretch" src="./assets/definition_engineer.png"></img>
					<aside class="notes">Im particularly interested in verb(2), to skillfully arrange for something to occur</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-transition="slide-in fade-out" >
					<h3>I got skills</h3>
					<img class="stretch" src="./assets/ronaldinho.gif"></img>
					<aside class="notes">Skills need to be honed, skills are measurable and comparable.</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-transition="slide-in fade-out" >
					<h3>Everyday is match day</h3>
					<aside class="notes">When I come to work I am expected to be at peak performance. Thats the best value for the organization, but whats the best for me, and how do we align those two?</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-transition="slide-in fade-out" >
					<h3>When do we train?</h3>
					<aside class="notes">So im not just talking about me anymore, as individuals and as professionals performing the tasks and duties we perform, when do we practice?
						</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-transition="slide-in fade-out" >
					<h3>Maximize peak performance</h3>
					<aside class="notes"> How do we improve? how do we increase the upper limit of what peak performance is? I think its clear that without training, peak performance naturally degrades</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-transition="slide-in fade-out" >
					<h3>Quick recap</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>The world is getting smaller</li>
						<li>Everyday is match day</li>
						<li>When do we train?</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">Most of our jobs require knowledge, not physical strength</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-transition="slide-in fade-out" >
					<h3>Think about it for a second</h3>
					<img class="stretch" src="./assets/doggo_vacuum.gif"></img>
				</section>

				<section data-transition="slide-in fade-out" >
					<h3>Couple questions</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Why?</li>
						<li>How?</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">Im actually going to leave the question of _when_ to you as an exercise. The questions Im actually going to discuss are why, and how</aside>
				</section>


				<section data-transition="slide-in fade-out" >
					<h3>Why?</h3>
					<aside class="notes">There needs to be some motivation for me to do things in my own time. Why should I improve my skills, whats in it for me?</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-transition="slide-in fade-out" >
					<h3>Perspective</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
						Doing something different may help you understand your frustrations, and the things that bring satisfaction. Why do you like or not like things? You might see the rationale in something if you take the time to find alternatives, or you might actually find a solution to a problem you've accepted as the status quo
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-transition="slide-in fade-out" >
					<h3>Time</h3>
					<aside class="notes">The point is not whether or not you have time. The point here is that you have as much time as you need. No deadlines. If you fail, its fine. If it takes 5 years, its fine.</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-transition="slide-in fade-out" >
					<h3>Focus</h3>
					<aside class="notes">In the absence of pressure, you get to take the time to focus on technique. I play table tennis, and no opponent is going to give you the opportunity to play the same shot until you've perfected it. Only conscious practice will allow this</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-transition="slide-in fade-out" >
					<h3>Why?</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Perspective</li>
						<li>Time</li>
						<li>Focus</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">Those are some of the more general reasons, Im going to give you some of my personal motivations</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-transition="slide-in fade-out" >
					<h3>Dopamine</h3>
					<aside class="notes"> Dopamine is responsible for incentivizing particular actions, reward, motivation and pleasure. Being good at what I do is my why. I genuinely enjoy the feeling of having a unique combination of knowledge and experience and tackling problems with perspective and understanding</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-transition="slide-in fade-out" >
					<h3>Im not getting paid</h3>
					<aside class="notes">Im going to stay on this slide for a bit, because I want this idea to sink in. Its incredibly important not to get paid to improve. Humans are easy to condition. Look into classical conditioning; positive and negative reinforcement. You need to remove money as the reward for your efforts. Getting paid will confuse your brain as to why, find your why, make sure that money is not it</aside>
				</section>

 				<!-- It might just help you understand the rationale behind something youve never understood -->
				<section data-transition="slide-in fade-out" >
					<h3>How?</h3>
					<aside class="notes">This will be different for each person and each role. But Im going to try to provide some specific, and some more general things you can practically implement in your life</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-transition="slide-in fade-out" >
					<h3>Do something impossible</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Create a programming language</li>
						<li>Make an operating system</li>
						<li>Design a database</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">We are users, consumers. Actually attempt to achieve something you deem impossible to achieve. Your purpose here is not to succeed. Your purpose is to understand</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-transition="slide-in fade-out" >
					<h3>Do something impossible</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Invent a strategy for problem solving</li>
						<li>Teach someone to do your job</li>
						<li>Optimize your human interactions</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">Have you thought about the problem of solving problems? Do you understand your role well enough to explain it? What knowledge will someone need to do what you do? Do YOU have the knowledge to do what you do? Do you ever send a message that just says hey? and then wait for the other person to respond?</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-transition="slide-in fade-out" >
					<h3>Expose yourself to knowledge</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Listen to podcasts</li>
						<li>Read blogs</li>
						<li>Watch TED talks</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">All of these are readily available, in your pocket. On your way to work. On your way home. Maybe dont watch videos while driving, but you understand what Im saying.</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-transition="slide-in fade-out" >
					<h3>Narrow your horizons</h3>
					<aside class="notes">Hone your skills, focus on whats necessary to be an expert in your field. 360 degrees of information is more than we can possibly take in, make the time to find what you love, make the time to be good at it</aside>
