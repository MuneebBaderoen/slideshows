                     For anybody who has studied HCI, shoutout to Gary Marsden for teaching me. (explain the law). We want the things we do frequently to be close, we're okay with less frequent actions being far away. If you want something to be easier to do, bring it closer, or make the target bigger

				<!-- Introduction -->
				<section data-transition="slide-in fade-out" >
					<h3>Horizons are 360 degrees</h3>
					<aside class="notes">Today we're going to explore a few ideas about professionalism, pride in the craft and more generally: happiness as a human being, and why thats important</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-transition="slide-in fade-out" >
					<h3>Broaden your horizons</h3>
					<aside class="notes">Has anyone ever said this to you? Have you ever said this to anyone else? What do I do with this statement as a person, in whatever field Im in. Depending on the role, it could have very different connotations. We're talking about the idea of it, not any particular thing</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-transition="slide-in fade-out" >
					<img class="stretch" src="./assets/definition_horizon.png"></img>
					<aside class="notes">We're going to box it to a definition here</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-transition="slide-in fade-out" >
					<h3>The world is getting smaller</h3>
					<aside class="notes">Information is much easier to get hold of than ever before, and increasingly so. More information available than you can consume in a lifetime, so we have to be selective.</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-transition="slide-in fade-out" >
					<h3>My horizons are narrowing everyday</h3>
					<aside class="notes">Practically, and literally speaking, theres nothing I can do about that. But it's not in my best interests to fight that progression, its an advantage that was not afforded to my predecessors. Hold onto that thought. The world is getting smaller, and narrowing horizons are a good thing according to the first definition. What does it mean for the second, the default.</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-transition="slide-in fade-out" >
					<h3>I used to be a developer</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
						I used to write code. I used to take specifications and tell computers to do the things other people were telling me to do.
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-transition="slide-in fade-out" >
					<h3>I am now a software engineer</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
						At least I consider myself to be, and a number of things have changed in my life and have changed my mind that have made me reassess my perception of myself
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-transition="slide-in fade-out" >
					<img class="stretch" src="./assets/definition_engineer.png"></img>
					<aside class="notes">Im particularly interested in verb(2), to skillfully arrange for something to occur</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-transition="slide-in fade-out" >
					<h3>I got skills</h3>
					<img class="stretch" src="./assets/ronaldinho.gif"></img>
					<aside class="notes">Skills need to be honed, skills are measurable and comparable.</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-transition="slide-in fade-out" >
					<h3>Everyday is match day</h3>
					<aside class="notes">When I come to work I am expected to be at peak performance. Thats the best value for the organization, but whats the best for me, and how do we align those two?</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-transition="slide-in fade-out" >
					<h3>When do we train?</h3>
					<aside class="notes">So im not just talking about me anymore, as individuals and as professionals performing the tasks we perform, when do we practice?
						</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-transition="slide-in fade-out" >
					<h3>Maximize peak performance</h3>
					<aside class="notes"> How do we improve? how do you improve your abilities to increase the upper limit of what peak performance is? Without training, peak performance naturally degrades</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-markdown data-separator-notes="^Note:">
					<textarea data-template>
						## Quick recap

						- The world is getting smaller
						- Everyday is match day
						- When do we train?
					</textarea>

				<section data-transition="slide-in fade-out" >
					<h3>Think about it for a second</h3>
					<img class="stretch" src="./assets/doggo_vacuum.gif"></img>
				</section>

				<section data-transition="slide-in fade-out" >
					<h3>Couple questions</h3>
					<ul>
						<li>Why?</li>
						<li>How?</li>
					</ul>
					<aside class="notes">Im actually going to leave the question of when to you as an exercise. The questions Im actually going to discuss are why, and how</aside>
				</section>


				<section data-transition="slide-in fade-out" >
					<h3>Why?</h3>
					<aside class="notes">There needs to be some motivation for me to do things in my own time. Why should I improve my skills, whats in it for me?</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-transition="slide-in fade-out" >
					<h3>Variety</h3>
					<aside class="notes">Work is not always interesting. Improving your skills outside of work does not necessarily mean that it will be immediately useful, but it might make you the one person in your team or in your organization that has a different perspective. </aside>
				</section>


				<section data-transition="slide-in fade-out" >
					<h3>Perspective</h3>
					<aside class="notes">
						Doing something different may help you understand your frustrations. Why do you like or not like things? How do you know what your peak performance is if you havent compared?
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-transition="slide-in fade-out" >
					<h3>Time</h3>
					<aside class="notes">No deadlines. If you fail, its fine. If it takes 5 years, its fine.</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-transition="slide-in fade-out" >
					<h3>Focus</h3>
					<aside class="notes">No pressure, you get to take the time to focus on technique. I play a lot of table tennis, and no opponent is going to give you the opportunity to play the same shot until you've perfected it. Only conscious practice will allow this</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-transition="slide-in fade-out" >
					<h3>Dopamine</h3>
					<aside class="notes">Being good at what I do is my why. I genuinely enjoy the feeling of having a unique combination of knowledge and experience and tackling problems with perspective and understanding</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-transition="slide-in fade-out" >
					<h3>Do it for free</h3>
					<aside class="notes">Im going to start here, because its incredibly important not to get paid to improve. Humans are easy to condition, so you need to remove money as the reward for your efforts</aside>
				</section>

				<section data-transition="slide-in fade-out" >
					<h3>How?</h3>
					<aside class="notes">This will be different for each person and each role. I can speak from the perspective of a software engineer, and you may find some parallels in these anecdotes to things you can practically implement in your life</aside>
