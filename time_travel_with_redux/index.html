                        Some users keep apps running for days and weeks. These are usually the folks with enough memory on device for android/ios to take good care of them. When the os decides its time to deallocate your app, you might be in the middle of some important background task.
                        You need to classify what state you're okay with losing, and what is critical for the app to function.
                        Uncontrolled access to global state is a terrible idea, especially if that state only lives in memory

                    Here's what talking to a client sounds like when they report a problem. What version of the app are you running? What device are you using? What version of android/ios are you running? What were you doing when the app crashed? Can you reproduce it?
